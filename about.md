Hi, I’m **Nuwan Samarasinghe**. I have **7+ years** of software development experience.  
This blog is where I share what I learn short notes, guides, code snippets, and ideas.  
Sometimes I also post random but interesting things.

## What I write about
- Practical how-tos and tips
- Code examples you can copy
- Debugging, testing, and performance notes
- Dev tools, CI/CD, and workflow
- Deploys, basics of ops, and trade-offs

## How I publish
- No fixed schedule
- Short notes for quick wins
- Longer posts when a topic needs more depth

## Who might like this
- Developers who prefer clear examples
- People who want real-world lessons, not buzzwords

## Topics I enjoy
- Backend and web development
- APIs and services
- Testing and reliability
- Developer experience and automation
